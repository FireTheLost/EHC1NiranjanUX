<h3 id="why-h3">&emsp;&emsp;Millions of penguins don't have access to basic computer facilities. Many have been deprived of the joy of using a computer.
Why? Because computers aren't made for penguins.
We at NiranjanUX LLC â„¢ aim to change that.
It's time penguins get to use computers.
By creating an easy-to-use, ergonomical kernel based on Linux,
one of the most popular operating systems, penguins will finally experience the joy of computers,
something that we take for granted.</h3>
